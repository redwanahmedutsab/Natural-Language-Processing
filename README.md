## 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research** repository! This repository serves as a central hub for my research, experiments, and projects related to the field of NLP. It will contain code, models, datasets, notebooks, papers, and findings as I explore and learn about various aspects of NLP.

---

### 🌐 About the Project

The goal of this repository is to:

* Explore core NLP concepts and techniques, including tokenization, embeddings, language modeling, text classification, and more.
* Experiment with cutting-edge NLP models such as transformers, BERT, GPT, and beyond.
* Build and evaluate practical NLP applications such as chatbots, text summarizers, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval systems.
* Contribute to the open-source community by sharing learnings, code, and resources.

### 🚀 Topics Covered

This repository may include:

* 📝 Text preprocessing and cleaning
* 🔍 Tokenization and embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
* 📚 Language models (n-gram, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers)
* 🧠 Fine-tuning large language models (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT, etc.)
* 🧮 NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, summarization, translation)
* 🧪 Experimentation with custom datasets
* 🔧 Tools and libraries (NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face, OpenAI API, etc.)
* 📊 Evaluation metrics and techniques
* 📝 Paper implementations and summaries
